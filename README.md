# We-Love-Movies

We Love Movies is an app that allows users access to information about movies, theaters, and reviews.

This project was developed as an assignment in the Thinkful.com engineering course. The frontend portion of this project was prebuilt while I contributed the backend code.

I used Express to build an API using RESTful API design principles. I also used Knex and PostgreSQL in this process.

The homepage of the We Love Movies user interface looks like this:
